# WebSoilSurveyData
This allows the users to download selected soil data from the Web Soil Survey.
Users need to have the lat (xx.xxxx) and lon (-xx.xxxx) coordinates to input in the app.
Since the code helps to access and download data from the Web Soil Survey, it can be used to access soil data from the US soil.
Only a limited number of soil properties can be accessed using this code and the code does not completely replace the use of the Web Soil Survey website.
Confirming the data obtained from this code with the website data is suggested.
